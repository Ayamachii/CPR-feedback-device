**Features:**
1. **Real-Time Rate Measurement**: Monitors and displays the rate of chest compressions in real-time, ensuring it aligns with recommended guidelines.
2. **Depth Indicator**: Displays the depth of chest compressions, guiding the rescuer to achieve optimal compression depth.
3. **Time Display**: Shows the elapsed time since CPR initiation, helping rescuers manage time effectively during resuscitation efforts.
4. **Chest Recoil Indicator**: Alerts the rescuer if there is insufficient chest recoil between compressions, promoting proper CPR technique.
5. **CPR Cycle Counter**: Counts the number of complete CPR cycles performed, aiding in tracking progress and ensuring consistency in resuscitation efforts.
